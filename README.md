# Advent of Code Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges for the some years, implemented in the Rust programming language. Advent of Code is an annual online event where participants solve daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th.

Each year's solutions are organized in separate folders, and within each folder, you'll find the solutions for each day's challenge.

## Prerequisites

To run the Rust solutions locally, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can follow the official Rust installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Usage

To run a specific solution, navigate to the project root folder, and use Cargo to build and run the program.

Run the latest solution with the following command:

```
cargo run
```

Run year solutions with the following command (2015 for example):

```
cargo run 2015
```

Run specific solution with the following command (2017 day 5 for example):

```
cargo run 2017 5
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a more optimized or cleaner solution for any of the challenges feel free to open a pull request. Please make sure to adhere to the Rust coding standards and provide a brief explanation of your changes.

If you find any bugs or issues with the existing solutions, please open an issue in the repository, and I'll try to address it as soon as possible.
